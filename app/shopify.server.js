// Prefer IPv4 for every outbound request in this process.
//
// This container hangs on IPv6 connect attempts (ConnectTimeoutError to
// 2620:127:f00e::), which is why optimize.server already sets this. But it set
// it LAZILY, from inside timedFetch — and timedFetch is only used for image
// downloads, never for admin.graphql. So on a freshly started container the
// first Shopify Admin API call still went out with Node's default resolution
// order. Setting it here, where every route's authenticate/graphql comes from,
// means it is in place before any request can be made.

// NOTE: there is intentionally no `billing: {...}` option below.
//
// This is a Managed Pricing app, so the Billing API is blocked for it —
// appSubscriptionCreate cannot be called, and plans are defined in the Partner
// Dashboard instead. The previous build still registered a billing config for a
// "Basic" / "Basic Annual" plan pair, which was doubly wrong: the library could
// never act on it, and those names don't exist in the four-tier
// Free/Starter/Growth/Pro model that plans.server.js actually resolves against.
// It is removed so there is exactly one place that describes a plan.
