// Mandatory privacy (GDPR) webhooks: customers/data_request, customers/redact,
// shop/redact.
//
// Shopify requires every public app to implement all three. They used to be
// declared in shopify.app.toml as compliance_topics pointing at the
// app/uninstalled endpoint, which returned 200 with a valid HMAC but did no
// redaction work at all — it only deleted sessions, and only for the uninstall
// topic. They now land here and each topic is handled explicitly.
//
// `authenticate.webhook` verifies the HMAC before returning. An invalid
// signature throws a Response, which is what Shopify's automated compliance
// check looks for — so an unsigned POST to this route is rejected, not accepted.
//
// What personal data this app actually stores, which is what makes the handlers
// below so short:
//   Session       — merchant (not customer) identity + access token, keyed by shop
//   ShopSettings  — one autoOptimize boolean, keyed by shop
//   UsageCounter  — monthly image counts, keyed by shop
//   ImageSize     — CDN url -> byte size cache; NOT shop-scoped and carries no
//                   personal data (Shopify CDN urls don't identify a store), so
//                   there is nothing here to redact per-shop.
// No customer records are stored or processed anywhere in the app.
